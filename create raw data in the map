#explaination
#         extend:This command is used to create new columns in the raw data by extracting specific pieces of data from the RawData column.
#         extract("pattern", captureGroup, RawData) is used to find specific patterns in the RawData and create new columns based on these patterns.
#         project:This command is used to select specific columns to keep in the result set, Only the listed columns will be included in the output.
#         where:These commands filter the data based on certain conditions.
#                  where destinationhost != "samplehost"
#                  where sourcehost != ""
#         The first where clause removes any rows where destinationhost is "samplehost".
#         The second where clause removes any rows where sourcehost is an empty string.
