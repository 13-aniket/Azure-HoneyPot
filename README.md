**Original Project**  
The original project features a honeypot virtual machine integrated with Azure Sentinel, providing hands-on experience in cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection. It captures real-world attack data, and its geolocation-based visualization offers insights into the global threat landscape, enhancing understanding of emerging threats.  

**Forked Extension**  
Building on the original project, I developed a Python script to extract IPs and usernames from failed RDP login attempt logs. The script identifies the top 10 most frequently used IPs and usernames, enabling focused analysis. I then performed threat intelligence on these top IPs to assess potential risks and threats. Finally, I visualized the results to provide a clearer understanding of the attack patterns and their origins.
